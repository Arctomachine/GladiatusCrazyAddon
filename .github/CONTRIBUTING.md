## First things first
Anyone can contribute to our project by sharing ideas, creating issues, reporting bugs or adding your own code via pull requests.

Most importantly, do not forget to respect our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon/blob/073d2a852adacc71344af2bce0c8dcf39f1c2f9f/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Creating an Issue/Pull request

Each issue (and a pull request) has its own template, they will help you and us to give us as much information as possible. Always check that you are not creating a duplicate, perhaps a similar issue was already created.

## Explore the Features Documentation

It is possible that a feature you want to suggest already exists, you can always explore our [Features Documentation](https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon/blob/master/documentation/features/README.md) first.

## Check the Troubleshooting guide

Some errors or bugs can be caused on your side and can also be easily fixed, thus we recommend to look out for your problem in the [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon/blob/master/documentation/Troubleshooting.md).

## Talk and ask in Discussions

We have a place to ask and discuss GCA or non-GCA related topics, use the GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/DinoDevs/GladiatusCrazyAddon/discussions). All questions belong to the Q&A section.
